## Philosophy

AI infrastructure should be:

- portable  
- observable  
- reliable  
- provider-agnostic  

AllTokens is designed as infrastructure rather than an application-layer tool.

## When to use AllTokens

Use AllTokens when you need a stable gateway layer between your application and rapidly evolving model providers.

Especially relevant for teams operating AI in production.
